# CRUDify
CrudUP is a C# library based on .NET 8 and Entity Framework Core, designed to simplify CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in applications. It provides a generic and extensible implementation of CRUD services, enabling developers to focus on their application's business logic without worrying about common database operations.
